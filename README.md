Hi! I am @Rabipedia across the web
I'm a MERN stack developer. A tech enthusiast who loves to program, and explore new things.


Skills: REACT / JS / Node / Express / MongoDB / HTML / CSS

A very condensed bio 🌸

Allowing concrete achievements - academic or otherwise - to speak for me is quite uncomfortable, but they are the most convenient metric to hand someone who has no other data.

🍁 January, 2021 I've completed my graduation from International Islamic University Chittagong.

🌻 Currently, I am learning MERN Stack development. 

🥅 2022 Goals: Learn more about web development and get a job.

🌺 I take great interest in reading,  I also love to travel and playing football. 

Coding-specific bit 💻

I am picky about my variable names, they ought to fit into context and be coherent in my code. Unless it's an experimental project. Then I'd use x and y until I am certain the program even works.
